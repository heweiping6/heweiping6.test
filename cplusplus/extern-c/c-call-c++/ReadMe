This is the example for C call C++ function.
-e1.h is the header for e1.cpp, and 'add' function will be call by C, so,
 we need add extern "C" in e1.h, 
 make sure the object will be compile as the C way.

-in main.c, need declear the 'add' function in main.c. 
 Because C can not identiffy "C", so can not include e1.h
